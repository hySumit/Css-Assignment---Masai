        <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>

        <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, compositions, and behavior of matter. It is fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>
        
        <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>

        <p>The <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">periodic table</span> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>

        <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>

        <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations.</i> Here's an example of a chemical reaction: </p>

        <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>

        <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas <var>(H<sub>2</sub>) </var> and oxygen gas <var>(O<sub>2</sub>) </var> to form water <var>(H<sub>2</sub>O).</var> </p>

        <h4>Important Concepts</h4>

        <p>Stoichemistry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>

        <p> <sub>Subscipts</sub> indicate the number of atom of each element in molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charge or the number of atoms in an ion. </p> 

        <h5>Conclusion</h5>

        <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the compositions of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry infulences every aspect of our lives.</p>
